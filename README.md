# A-Survey-on-Diabetes-Detection-Based-on-Machine-Learning-Classifiers

In this work, a model that assists in the earlier identification
of diabetes by focusing on essential disease characteristics is
created utilising six different classifier algorithms. These
techniques are employed to develop a model. The methods of
LR, KNN, SVM, NB,RF, and DT were applied, and the dataset
used was PIDD, which was obtained from the UCI ML
Repository. Create a system for handling the data during
the trials and organise it. In order to tackle the issue of class
unbalance, the null values are replaced with the average of the
features class, and the over-sampling method is used as a
solution to the problem.
Accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, and F-score are some
of the major performance criteria that have been evaluated.
Dataset consists of 768 instances and eight features with a single class
label, where a value of '0' indicates patients who do not have
diabetes and a value of '1' indicates patients who do have
diabetes. The entire thing is organised into a single table.
Figure 4 depicts the overall outcomes of both diabetic and nondiabetic
patients, with a total of 268 diabetic patients and 500
non-diabetic patients included. There are both tabular and
graphical representations of the results that can be seen in paper.
Table I provides a summary of the findings from all of the
classifiers and includes all of the performance indicators that
are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of each classifier. The
individual performance of an algorithm is represented here by
Figure 5, which is based on statistical indicators. According to
the data, the Random Forest (RF) classifier has the highest
accuracy, coming in at 87.66%. As a result, it is adequate for
making predictions regarding diabetes mellitus using our
model.
